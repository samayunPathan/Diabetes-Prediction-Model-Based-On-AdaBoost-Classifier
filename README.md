# Early Diabetes Predictive Model Based on AdaBoost Classifier Algorithm

This repository houses the code and data for predicting diabetes risk using the AdaBoost classifier. The project utilizes Python libraries including pandas, seaborn, numpy, and matplotlib for data analysis, visualization, and model development.

This thesis proposes a novel approach to the early prediction of diabetes using the AdaBoost classification algorithm.The objectives of this project is to construct a predictive model that can identify persons at risk of getting diabetes with high accuracy and at an early stage.The research method begins with thorough data gathering, spanning a varied variety of patient factors, including demographic information, medical history, and biochemical markers. Feature selection and preprocessing procedures are applied to enhance the quality of input data.Through the experimentation and model change, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the AdaBoost classifier in early diabetes prediction. The model is assessed using several performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on a large dataset of patient records. Results reveal that the proposed prediction model obtains greater performance compared to traditional machine learning algorithms. This research helps to 
the ongoing efforts to prevent diabetes by providing a strong and effective predictive tool that can assist healthcare practitioners in identifying those at risk of developing the illness. It also emphasizes the potential of AdaBoost as a significant algorithm in medical predictive model.



## Methodology

AdaBoost Classifier :

AdaBoost Classifier is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple weak classifiers to form a strong classifier. In this study, decision trees with a maximum depth of 1 were used as weak classifiers. The number of weak classifiers, or estimators, was set to 50.
